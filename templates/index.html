      <h2>"About Us"</h2>
      <p>
        In our Information Security (IS) project, we have developed a robust and
        user-friendly Password Strength Checker application. Password security
        is a fundamental aspect of digital security, and our project aims to
        provide a practical solution to help users create stronger and more
        secure passwords. Our application utilizes Machine Learning (ML) models
        and the Flask framework to achieve this. We have trained our ML model to
        evaluate the strength of passwords based on various factors, including
        character complexity and length. <br />
        Using techniques like Pickle and Dill, we have successfully incorporated
        the trained model into our web application, enabling users to input
        their passwords and receive instant feedback on the strength of their
        passwords. Our web-based Password Strength Checker not only evaluates
        the strength of passwords but also provides valuable suggestions for
        improving password security. It offers a seamless user experience with a
        user-friendly interface and a sleek navigation bar.<br />
        Additionally, our project incorporates an "About Us" section,
        demonstrating our commitment to providing users with essential
        information about our development team and the motivation behind this
        crucial tool. Our project's educational value lies in teaching users
        about the importance of strong passwords and best practices for
        enhancing digital security. It is a practical and insightful tool for
        both beginners and experienced users looking to secure their online
        accounts effectively.
